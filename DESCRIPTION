Title: some minimal function templates for R
Version: 0.3
Author: Witold Wiecek
Maintainer: Witold Wiecek <witold.wiecek@gmail.com>
Description: This tiny package contains mostly one-liner shorthand functions 
    such as logit, mean and interval, display as percent etc. I also wanted 
    avoid going into larger packages for basic functions.
